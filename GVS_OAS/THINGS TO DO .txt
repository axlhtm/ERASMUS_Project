THINGS TO DO: 
1. Create two dictionaries called "Pressure_EAST" and "Pressure_WEST" consisting of hydrants pressure of data frames for each month. 

2. Create two dictionaries called "Activations_EAST" and "Activations_WEST" consisting of hydrant status of data frames for each month. 

3. Delete "VASCA_GRANDE NODE"

4. Filter the pressure matrix based on activations. Keep the data if the hydrant is used, delete the data if not. 

5. Find the minimum pressure for each month and store it as a list called "minimum_EAST" and "minimum_WEST". For the non-irrigation season, put a positive infinite number.

6. Create two data frames namely Pressure_EAST_concatenated and Pressure_WEST_concatenated which of consist a pressure value for activated hydrants.

7. Create two data frames namely Activations_EAST_conc and Activations_WEST_conc which consist of activation status of hydrants.

X. Infert every data frame within all four dictionaries. The original MATLAB code uses the X axis as a timestep and the Y axis as hydrant ID.
