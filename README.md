## ERASMUS Project

**Project Description**

This project, conducted through the ERASMUS program and in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, aimed to assist water utilities in Campania, Italy, in optimizing pressure management within their irrigation networks. This was achieved by implementing innovative off-grid automatic Green Valve Systems (GVS) at strategically chosen nodes. The successful implementation resulted in a significant average pressure reduction of 61%.

**Responsibilities**

* **Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing:** I meticulously cleaned and pre-processed historical hydrant usage data to ensure its accuracy and facilitate insightful analysis.
* **Critical Node Identification:** Employing the prepared data, I pinpointed critical hydrant nodes experiencing the highest number of concurrent hydrant connections.
* **Energy Balance Analysis:** To evaluate the effectiveness of the GVS, I rigorously analyzed the pre- and post-installation energy balance at the key nodes equipped with these systems.
