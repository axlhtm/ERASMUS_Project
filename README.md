## ERASMUS Project

**Project Description**

This project, conducted through the ERASMUS program and in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, aimed to assist water utilities in Campania, Italy, in optimizing pressure management within their irrigation networks. This was achieved by implementing innovative Off-grid Automatic System (OAS) and Green Valve Systems (GVS) at strategically chosen nodes. The successful implementation resulted in a significant average pressure reduction of 40%.

**Responsibilities**

* Performed data cleaning and pre-processing of historical hydrant usage data over six years period.
* Modelled leakage in the water distribution network.
* Identified critical hydrant nodes with the highest number of contemporary hydrant connections.
* Analyzed the pre- and post-installation energy balance at critical nodes equipped with GVS.
* Wrote and published results in a notable scientific journal.

**Results**


**Publications** 

* 3rd International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis & Computing and Control for the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI). Rethinking On-Demand Irrigation Systems Using IOT Stand-Alone Technologies.
